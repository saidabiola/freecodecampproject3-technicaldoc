          <p id='head'>Django at a glance</p>
          <p>Because Django was developed in a fast-paced newsroom environment, 
            it was designed to make common web      development tasks fast and easy. 
            Here’s an informal overview of how to write a database-driven web app with Django.
          </p>

            <p>The goal of this document is to give you enough technical specifics to understand how Django works, 
              but this isn’t intended to be a tutorial or reference
            </p>
              <p>Make sure you have your python installed on your computer before running django, 
                then install django as well. Note that django can be installed using a 'pip install django'. 
                pip is a python tool for installing pyhton libraries.

      <!--models section-->
      <section id='designing_models' class='main-section'>
        <header>Designing models</header>
        <article>
          <p>Although you can use Django without a database, it comes with an object-relational 
            mapper in which you describe your database layout in Python code.
          </p>

          <p>The data-model syntax offers many rich ways of representing your models – so far, 
            it’s been solving many years’ worth of database-schema problems. Here’s a quick example:
          </p>

        <div class='code'>
              <code class='models-code'>
                from django.db import models<br>
                class Reporter(models.Model):<br>
                full_name = models.CharField(max_length=70)<br>
                def __str__(self):<br>
                  return self.full_name<br>

                  
                class Article(models.Model):<br>
                    pub_date = models.DateField()<br>
                    headline = models.CharField(max_length=200)<br>
                    content = models.TextField()<br>
                    reporter = models.ForeignKey(Reporter, on_delete=models.CASCADE)<br>

                    def __str__(self):<br>
                      return self.headline<br>
              </code>
          </div>
          <p id='head'>Install it</p>
          <p>Next, run the Django command-line utilities to create the database tables automatically:</p>

          <div class='code'>
              <code class='models-code'>
                $ python manage.py makemigrations<br>
                $ python manage.py migrate
              </code>
          </div>

          <p>The makemigrations command looks at all your available models and creates migrations for 
            whichever tables don’t already exist. migrate runs the migrations and creates tables in your database, 
            as well as optionally providing much richer schema control.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>

<!--urls section-->
      <section id='designing_urls' class='main-section'>
        <header>Designing URLs</header>
        <article>
          <p>A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality web application. 
            Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.
          </p>

          <p>To design URLs for an app, you create a Python module called a URLconf. 
            A table of contents for your app, it contains a mapping between URL patterns and 
            Python callback functions. URLconfs also serve to decouple URLs from Python code.
          </p>

          <p>Here’s what a URLconf might look like for the Reporter/Article example above:</p>

        <div class='code'>
          <code class='urls-code'>
            from django.urls import path<br>

            from . import views<br>

            urlpatterns = [<br>
                path("articles/<int:year>/", views.year_archive),<br>
                path("articles/<int:year>/<int:month>/", views.month_archive),<br>
                path("articles/<int:year>/<int:month>/<int:pk>/", views.article_detail),<br>
            ]
          </code>
        </div>
          <p>The code above maps URL paths to Python callback functions (“views”). 
            The path strings use parameter tags to “capture” values from the URLs. 
            When a user requests a page, Django runs through each path, in order, 
            and stops at the first one that matches the requested URL. (If none of them matches, 
            Django calls a special-case 404 view.) This is blazingly fast, because the paths are 
            compiled into regular expressions at load time.
          </p>

          <p>Once one of the URL patterns matches, Django calls the given view, which is a Python function.
             Each view gets passed a request object – which contains request metadata – and the values 
             captured in the pattern.
          </p>

        </article>
      </section>

<!--views section-->
      <section id='writing_views' class='main-section'>
        <header>Writing views</header>
        <article>
          <p>Each view is responsible for doing one of two things: 
            Returning an HttpResponse object containing the content for the requested page, 
            or raising an exception such as Http404. The rest is up to you.
          </p>

          </p>Generally, a view retrieves data according to the parameters, loads a template and renders 
              the template with the retrieved data. Here’s an example view for year_archive from above:
          </p>

        <div class='code'>
          <code class='views-code'>
            from django.shortcuts import render<br>

            from .models import Article<br>


            def year_archive(request, year):<br>
                a_list = Article.objects.filter(pub_date__year=year)<br>
                context = {"year": year, "article_list": a_list}<br>
                return render(request, "news/year_archive.html", contex<br>
          </code>
        </div>
          <p>This example uses Django’s template system, which has several powerful features
             but strives to stay simple enough for non-programmers to use.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>

<!--templates section-->
      <section id='designing_templates' class='main-section'>
        <header>Designing templates</header>
        <article>
          <p>The code above loads the news/year_archive.html template.</p>
          <p>Django has a template search path, which allows you to minimize redundancy among templates.
             In your Django settings, you specify a list of directories to check for templates with DIRS. 
             If a template doesn’t exist in the first directory, it checks the second, and so on.
          </p>

          <p>Let’s say the news/year_archive.html template was found. Here’s what that might look like:</p>


        <div class='code'>
          <code class='templates-code'>
              {% extends "base.html" %}<br>

              {% block title %}Articles for {{ year }}{% endblock %}<br>

              {% block content %}<br>
              Articles for {{ year }}<br>

              {% for article in article_list %}<br>
              {{ article.headline }}<br>
              By {{ article.reporter.full_name }}<br>
              Published {{ article.pub_date|date:"F j, Y" }}<br>
              {% endfor %}<br>
              {% endblock %}<br>
          </code>

        </div>
          <p>Variables are surrounded by double-curly braces. {{ article.headline }} means “Output the 
            value of the article’s headline attribute.” But dots aren’t used only for attribute lookup.
             They also can do dictionary-key lookup, index lookup and function calls.
          </p>

          <p>Note {{ article.pub_date|date:"F j, Y" }} uses a Unix-style “pipe” (the “|” character). 
            This is called a template filter, and it’s a way to filter the value of a variable.
             In this case, the date filter formats a Python datetime object in the given format 
             (as found in PHP’s date function).
          </p>

          <p>You can chain together as many filters as you’d like. You can write custom template filters.
             You can write custom template tags, which run custom Python code behind the scenes.
          </p>

          <p>Finally, Django uses the concept of “template inheritance”.
             That’s what the {% extends "base.html" %} does. It means “First load the template called ‘base’, 
             which has defined a bunch of blocks, and fill the blocks with the following blocks.” 
             In short, that lets you dramatically cut down on redundancy in templates: each template
              has to define only what’s unique to that template.

        <header>Writing your first django app part 1</header>
        <article>
          <p>Let’s learn by example.</p>
          <p>Throughout this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic poll application.</p>
          <p>It’ll consist of two parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.</li>
            <li>An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We’ll assume you have Django installed already. You can tell Django is installed and which 
            version by running the following command in a shell prompt (indicated by the $ prefix):
          </p>


          <div class='code'>
            <code>$ python -m django --version</code>
          </div>

          <p>If Django is installed, you should see the version of your installation. 
            If it isn’t, you’ll get an error telling “No module named django”.
          </p>

          <p>This tutorial is written for Django 5.0, which supports Python 3.10 and later.
             If the Django version doesn’t match, you can refer to the tutorial for your version of Django
              by using the version switcher at the bottom right corner of this page, or update Django to the
               newest version. If you’re using an older version of Python, check What Python version can I use 
               with Django? to find a compatible version of Django.
          </p>

          <p id='head'>Creating a project</p>
          <p >If this is your first time using Django, you’ll have to take care of some initial setup. 
            Namely, you’ll need to auto-generate some code that establishes a Django project –
             a collection of settings for an instance of Django, including database configuration,
              Django-specific options and application-specific settings
          </p>

          <p>From the command line, cd into a directory where you’d like to store your code, 
            then run the following command:
          </p>        

          <div class='code'>
              <code>$ django-admin startproject mysite</code>
          </div>

          <p>This will create a mysite directory in your current directory</p>
          <p>Let’s look at what startproject created:</p>

          <div class='code'>
              <code class='part1-code'>mysite/<br>
                  manage.py<br>
                  mysite/<br>
                      __init__.py<br>
                      settings.py<br>
                      urls.py<br>
                      asgi.py<br>
                      wsgi.py
                </code>
          </div>
            <p>These files are:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>The outer mysite/ root directory is a container for your project. 
                Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like.
              </li>

              <li>manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in 
                various ways. You can read all the details about manage.py in django-admin and manage.py.
              </li>

              <li>The inner mysite/ directory is the actual Python package for your project.
                 Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything 
                 inside it (e.g. mysite.urls).              
              </li>

              <li>mysite/__init__.py: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should
                 be considered a Python package
              </li>
              <li>mysite/settings.py: Settings/configuration for this Django project. Django settings 
                will tell you all about how settings work.
              </li>

              <li>mysite/urls.py: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents”
                 of your Django-powered site.
              </li>

              <li>mysite/asgi.py: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project</li>
              <li>mysite/wsgi.py: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class='head'>The development serve</p>
            <p >Let’s verify your Django project works. Change into the outer mysite directory,

<!--django app paart 2 section-->

    <header>writing your first django app part 2</header>
    <article>
      <p id='head'>Database setup</p>
      <p >Now, open up mysite/settings.py. It’s a normal Python module with 
        module-level variables representing Django settings.
      </p>

      <p>By default, the configuration uses SQLite. If you’re new to databases, or you’re just 
        interested in trying Django, this is the easiest choice. SQLite is included in Python, 
        so you won’t need to install anything else to support your database. When starting your
         first real project, however, you may want to use a more scalable database like PostgreSQL,
          to avoid database-switching headaches down the road.
      </p>

      <p>Also, note the INSTALLED_APPS setting at the top of the file. That holds the names of
         all Django applications that are activated in this Django instance. Apps can be used in
          multiple projects, and you can package and distribute them for use by others in their projects.
      </p>

      <p>By default, INSTALLED_APPS contains the following apps, all of which come with Django:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>django.contrib.admin – The admin site. You’ll use it shortly.</li>
          <li>django.contrib.auth – An authentication system.</li>

          <li>django.contrib.contenttypes – A framework for content types.</li>

          <li>django.contrib.sessions – A session framework.</li>

          <li>django.contrib.messages – A messaging framework.</li>
     
     <li>django.contrib.staticfiles – A framework for managing static files.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>These applications are included by default as a convenience for the common case.</p>
        <p>Some of these applications make use of at least one database table, though, so we need to
           create the tables in the database before we can use them. To do that, run the following command:
        </p>

        <div class='code'>
            <code>$ python manage.py migrate</code>
        </div>

        <p>The migrate command looks at the INSTALLED_APPS setting and creates any necessary database 
          tables according to the database settings in your mysite/settings.py file and the database 
          migrations shipped with the app (we’ll cover those later). You’ll see a message for each 
          migration it applies. If you’re interested, run the command-line client for your database 
          and type \dt (PostgreSQL), SHOW TABLES; (MariaDB, MySQL), .tables (SQLite), or 
          SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM USER_TABLES; (Oracle) to display the tables Django created.
      </p>

        <p>A view is a “type” of web page in your Django application that generally serves a specific
           function and has a specific template. For example, in a blog application, you might have the 
           following views:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Blog homepage – displays the latest few entries.</li>

          <li>Entry “detail” page – permalink page for a single entry.</li>

          <li>Year-based archive page – displays all months with entries in the given year.</li>

          <li>Month-based archive page – displays all days with entries in the given month.</li>

          <li>Day-based archive page – displays all entries in the given day.</li>

          <li>Comment action – handles posting comments to a given entry.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>In our poll application, we’ll have the following four views:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Question “index” page – displays the latest few questions.</li>

          <li>Question “detail” page – displays a question text, with no results but with a form to vote.</li>

          <li>Question “results” page – displays results for a particular question.</li>

          <li>Vote action – handles voting for a particular choice in a particular question.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>In Django, web pages and other content are delivered by views. Each view is represented by
           a Python function (or method, in the case of class-based views). Django will choose a view 
           by examining the URL that’s requested (to be precise, the part of the URL after the domain name).

        <p id-'head'>Write a minimal form</p>

        <p id='head'>Form should go in here...</p>
        <p>A quick rundown:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The above template displays a radio button for each question choice. 
            The value of each radio button is the associated question choice’s ID. 
            The name of each radio button is "choice". That means, when somebody 
            selects one of the radio buttons and submits the form, it’ll send the 
            POST data choice=# where # is the ID of the selected choice. This is the basic concept of HTML forms.
          </li>
          <li>We set the form’s action to {% url 'polls:vote' question.id %}, and we 
            set method="post". Using method="post" (as opposed to method="get") is very 
            important, because the act of submitting this form will alter data server-side. 
            Whenever you create a form that alters data server-side, use method="post". 
            This tip isn’t specific to Django; it’s good web development practice in general.
          </li>
          <li>forloop.counter indicates how many times the for tag has gone through its loop</li>

          <li>Since we’re creating a POST form (which can have the effect of modifying data), 
            we need to worry about Cross Site Request Forgeries. Thankfully, you don’t have to 
            worry too hard, because Django comes with a helpful system for protecting against it.
            In short, all POST forms that are targeted at internal URLs should use the {% csrf_token %} 
            template tag.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p id='head'>Introducing automated testing</p>
        <p id='head'>What are automated tests?</p>
        <p>Tests are routines that check the operation of your code.</p>
        <p>Testing operates at different levels. Some tests might apply to a tiny detail
           (does a particular model method return values as expected?) while others examine 
           the overall operation of the software (does a sequence of user inputs on the site 
           produce the desired result?). That’s no different from the kind of testing you did
            earlier in Tutorial 2, using the shell to examine the behavior of a method, or running 
            the application and entering data to check how it behaves.
        </p>

        <p>What’s different in automated tests is that the testing work is done for you by the system.
          You create a set of tests once, and then as you make changes to your app, you can check that 
          your code still works as you originally intended, without having to perform time consuming manual testing.
      </p>

      <p id='head'>Why you need to create tests?</p>
      <p>So why create tests, and why now?</p>
      <p>You may feel that you have quite enough on your plate just learning Python/Django, 
        and having yet another thing to learn and do may seem overwhelming and perhaps unnecessary. 
        After all, our polls application is working quite happily now; going through the trouble of 
        creating automated tests is not going to make it work any better. If creating the polls 
        application is the last bit of Django programming you will ever do, then true, you don’t need 
        to know how to create automated tests. But, if that’s not the case, now is an excellent time to learn.
    </p>

    <p id='head'>Tests will save you time</p>
    <p>Up to a certain point, ‘checking that it seems to work’ will be a satisfactory test.
       In a more sophisticated application, you might have dozens of complex interactions between components.
    </p>    

    <p>A change in any of those components could have unexpected consequences on the application’s behavior.
       Checking that it still ‘seems to work’ could mean running through your code’s functionality with 
       twenty different variations of your test data to make sure you haven’t broken something - 
       not a good use of your time.
    </p>

    <p>That’s especially true when automated tests could do this for you in seconds. If something’s gone wrong, 
      tests will also assist in identifying the code that’s causing the unexpected behavior.
    </p>

    <p>Sometimes it may seem a chore to tear yourself away from your productive, creative programming work 
      to face the unglamorous and unexciting business of writing tests, particularly when you know your
      code is working properly.
    </p>

    <p>However, the task of writing tests is a lot more fulfilling than spending hours testing your
       application manually or trying to identify the cause of a newly-introduced problem.
    </p>

    <p id='head'>Tests don’t just identify problems, they prevent them</p>
    <p>It’s a mistake to think of tests merely as a negative aspect of development.</p>
    <p>Without tests, the purpose or intended behavior of an application might be rather opaque. 
      Even when it’s your own code, you will sometimes find yourself poking around in it trying to 
      find out what exactly it’s doing.
  </p>

  <p>Tests change that; they light up your code from the inside, and when something goes wrong, 
    they focus light on the part that has gone wrong - even if you hadn’t even realized it had gone wrong.
  </p>

  <p id='head'>Tests make your code more attractiv</p>
  <p>You might have created a brilliant piece of software, but you will find that many other developers 
    will refuse to look at it because it lacks tests; without tests, they won’t trust it. Jacob Kaplan-Moss, 
    one of Django’s original developers, says “Code without tests is broken by design.”
  </p>

  <p>That other developers want to see tests in your software before they take it seriously is yet another 
    reason for you to start writing tests
  </p>

  <p id='head'>Tests help teams work together</p>
  <p>The previous points are written from the point of view of a single developer maintaining an application. 
    Complex applications will be maintained by teams. Tests guarantee that colleagues don’t inadvertently break
     your code (and that you don’t break theirs without knowing). If you want to make a living as a Django 
     programmer, you must be good at writing tests!

  <article>
    <p>Aside from the HTML generated by the server, web applications generally need to serve additional 
      files — such as images, JavaScript, or CSS — necessary to render the complete web page. In Django,
       we refer to these files as “static files”.
    </p>

    <p>For small projects, this isn’t a big deal, because you can keep the static files somewhere your
       web server can find it. However, in bigger projects – especially those comprised of multiple 
       apps – dealing with the multiple sets of static files provided by each application starts to get tricky.
    </p>

    <p>That’s what django.contrib.staticfiles is for: it collects static files from each of your applications
       (and any other places you specify) into a single location that can easily be served in production.
    </p>    

    <p id='head'>Customize your app’s look and feel</p>
    <p>First, create a directory called static in your polls directory. Django will look for static 
      files there, similarly to how Django finds templates inside polls/templates/.
    </p>

    <p>Django’s STATICFILES_FINDERS setting contains a list of finders that know how to discover static 
      files from various sources. One of the defaults is AppDirectoriesFinder which looks for a “static” 
      subdirectory in each of the INSTALLED_APPS, like the one in polls we just created. The admin site uses
       the same directory structure for its static files.
    </p>

    <p>Within the static directory you have just created, create another directory called polls and within that
       create a file called style.css. In other words, your stylesheet should be at polls/static/polls/style.
       css. Because of how the AppDirectoriesFinder staticfile finder works, you can refer to this static file 
       in Django as polls/style.css, similar to how you reference the path for templates.

        <p id='head'>Customize the admin form</p>
        <p>By registering the Question model with admin.site.register(Question), Django was able to 
          construct a default form representation. Often, you’ll want to customize how the admin form 
          looks and works. You’ll do this by telling Django the options you want when you register the object.
        </p>

        <p>Let’s see how this works by reordering the fields on the edit form. Replace the admin.site.
          register(Question) line with:
        </p>

        <div class='code'>
            <code class='part7code'>
              from django.contrib import admin<br>

              from .models import Question<br>


              class QuestionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):<br>
                  fields = ["pub_date", "question_text"]<br>


              admin.site.register(Question, QuestionAdmin)<br>
            </code>
        </div>

        <p>You’ll follow this pattern – create a model admin class, then pass it as the second argument 
          to admin.site.register() – any time you need to change the admin options for a model.

      <p id='head'>Installing Django Debug Toolbar</p>
      <p>Django Debug Toolbar is a useful tool for debugging Django web applications. 
        It’s a third-party package maintained by the Jazzband organization. The toolbar 
        helps you understand how your application functions and to identify problems. 
        It does so by providing panels that provide debug information about the current request and response.
      </p>

      <p>To install a third-party application like the toolbar, you need to install the package 
        by running the below command within an activated virtual environment.
      </p>

      <div class='code'>
          <code>$ python -m pip install django-debug-toolbar</code>
      </div>
      
      <p>Third-party packages that integrate with Django need some post-installation setup to 
        integrate them with your project. Often you will need to add the package’s Django app to
         your INSTALLED_APPS setting. Some packages need other changes, like additions to your URLconf (urls.py).
      </p>

      <p>Django Debug Toolbar requires several setup steps. Follow them in its installation guide.
         The steps are not duplicated in this tutorial, because as a third-party package, 
         it may change separately to Django’s schedule.
      </p>

      <p>Once installed, you should be able to see the DjDT “handle” on the right side of the browser
         window when you refresh the polls application. Click it to open the debug toolbar and use the
          tools in each panel. See the panels documentation page for more information on what the panels show.
